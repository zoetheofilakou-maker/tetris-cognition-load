# Weekly Research Log – May 8, 2025

## What is done
- Replaced old GitHub repo with updated sandbox version
- Integrated high-level event marker functions in `api.py`
- Used UDP protocol to send real-time markers like `StartGame`, `LineClear`, and `GameOver`
- Fixed marker display issues in iMotions (e.g., `StartGame` not appearing)
- Clarified scene vs standard markers (`M;1` and `M;2`)

##  Questions or Issues
- Still troubleshooting why some markers don’t show in CSV export

## Next Steps
