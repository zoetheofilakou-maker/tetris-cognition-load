-- # write here:
-- #    - things to ask
-- #    - what ifs
-- #    - possibilities

- is there less of an error for the game setter if the code levels are in separate files versus setting a boolean at the beginning?
- maybe turn blocks grey when game is over or time is over to have more clearer ending
- move next-block-info to diffenet place, to see clearer if person is looking at it?

---Functionality---

◘ Change pygame to only accept arrowKey inputs to take care of accidental pressings + make processing speed faster (pygame.event.set_allowed([pygame.QUIT, pygame.UP,.....]))



----------------------------------    B U G S    ----------------------------------

◘ Resizing the screen while playing, will create empty space on the right side (not wanted, have to fix this)
    (the size of data_surface and grid_surface compared to the window screen is the problem)


----------------------------------    D O N E ----------------------------------

19. Added a boolean to control whether to show or not to show score, total_line_clears, next_block or timer
20. Fixed the game_over_screen to show correctly timer_surfaces
21. Added code to Base Level to collect and save data from each key.press and each time a new block is the going to be the current_block + also save the constant speed 1 time at the start
22. Added code to Find Skill Level to collect and save data + fixed a couple bugs
23. Added a separator for saved data
